## Issues
* Some struggling with styling and especially override default Bootstrap styles
* Not fully satisfied with the optimization / efficiency of the code
*The main issues I (Valerie) had while coding using Bootstrap and LESS were I couldn't get the border colors to change and on some of container-fluids I used, it was looking more like a container was used. Alex was able to fix those issues.
*It also took me a while to figure out how to get the fig caption to line up on the right, while still aligning the icons vertical on the contact page. It took me a while to figure out, but I eventually got it using two flex boxes in bootstrap, and using a align-items-baseline.
