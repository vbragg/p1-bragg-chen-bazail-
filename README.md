# p1-bragg-chen-bazail-
group project 1 for AW2

The main issues I (Valerie) had while coding using Bootstrap and LESS were I couldn't get the border colors to change and on some of container-fluids I used, it was looking more like a container was used. Alex was able to fix those issues.

It also took me a while to figure out how to get the fig caption to line up on the right, while still aligning the icons vertical on the contact page. It took me a while to figure out, but I eventually got it using two flex boxes in bootstrap, and using a align-items-baseline.

The only resources I used were
-Bootstrap documentation https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/
-LESS documentation http://lesscss.org/
-Pulled some content off a local chocolate shop's website https://spagnvola.com/
-Also referenced various lectures throughout the project
